This paper outlines the analysis of the current rates of depression, anxiety, and psychosis among university students in Kilifi County while exploring the relationships between mental health outcomes and socioeconomic factors such as income, education level, and access to healthcare. By examining these variables, the paper explains how healthcare access and socioeconomic disparities contribute to mental health challenges in the target population. Additionally, the team employed machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, to predict mental health outcomes and identify the critical predictors among the socioeconomic and healthcare-related factors. This approach offers insights into the effectiveness of predictive modeling for mental health conditions to inform targeted interventions and mental health policies in university settings.
